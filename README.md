#### Projects
	Successfully implemented real-time object detection on a mobile robot by Fine Tuning and optimizing algorithms and models using PyTorch, OpenCV, GIT, NVIDIA Jetson nano kit and Intel RealSense depth camera. (YOLO, Faster-RCNN_ResNet_50_fpn).
â€¢	A multiclassification project utilizing Tiny VGG and EfficientNet_b0 Convolutional Neural Network architectures for precise identification of food types with the help of Python and PyTorch Framework.
â€¢	Contributed to advancing the image segmentation capabilities of a mobile robotic platform using deep learning U-Net architecture to enhance robotic perception.
â€¢	Developing Object Tracking algorithm through the implementation of YOLOv8 with transfer learning on a Raspberry Pi 4 for robotic navigation.
â€¢	Designed and developed an X-Y Pen Plotter using Esp-32 Spark-Fun microcontroller and Arduino IDE to draw a Nicholas House.
